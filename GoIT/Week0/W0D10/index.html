    <p class="centred">I'm starting in IT after 4 years in public sector!
        I want to change my life and to work with interesting and innovative
        things without any bureaucracy and backward elements!
    <br>
        I have two master degrees in economy and HR. In the beginning of 2018 I'll also graduated from National academy of public administration
        with master's degree in management of public institutions. But I've understood that it isn't
        my vocation, I don't like public sector in our country and I want to
        concentrate on my personal development! That's why I'm specifically
        here and in IT - at all!

    <p> <b>About me:</b> I'm married with beautiful woman - Ann, and we have little son - Mykhael.
        My family is the main thing in my life.
        <br>
        What about my hobbies: I like to play computer games (above all - MMORPG),
        to read books (generally fantastic, last time prefer - LitRPG) and to watch
        films or serials (Marvel is good, of course Game of Thrones, Big Bank Theory, etc).
        Also I'm interesting in sport. I'm good in ping-pong, archery, shooting and boxing.
        Few months in a year I attend gym.
